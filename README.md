# Diabetes Risk Prediction Workflow
This project builds and evaluates machine learning models to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes risk using lab test results and key health indicators. The workflow covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering to improve model performance and generalizability. Moreover, to address the problem of class imbalance in the dataset, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is applied to enhance minority-class representation. Multiple supervised models are trained and evaluated using a variety of metrics for balanced performance assessment. See the below sections for more details. Cross-validation is used during training and hyperparameter tuning to reduce overfitting and ensure robust generalization.
